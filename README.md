# Directree üå≥

A simple directory structure template creator and loader!

The main idea of Directree is to allow the user to configure a reusable directory template allowing for quick and easy directory structure recreation with a single button press.

Directree came about as a need for my main love and trade: Embedded and RTL design, where the lack of any real advancement in design tools, has made it hard to create a uniform project directory structure, making me want to fix that with this; my very first Electron.js app, and my first ever web-based project.

## What‚ùì

Directree allows for directory structure template creation via a simple and intuitive GUI:

- TODO: Add a screenshot/gif of creating a template manually once ready

Directree can also load an already existing directory structure from the user's filesystem and make a new template from it:

- TODO: Add a screenshot/gif of once ready

Directree can be used to load/edit/save previously made templates:

- TODO: Add a screenshot/gif once ready

## Who‚ùì

I am AB. from CoffeeTechTalk,\
I am an Electrical Engineer by trade, specializing in Embedded design and RTL, as such I am still getting used to writing proper TypeScript, CSS and HTML, yet I took on this project to help myself learn, and to add a few more tools to my disposal.
